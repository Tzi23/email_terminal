Whether you have served with the Foundation for long or are a newcomer, welcome. This is a job that many do not have the fortitude to commit to. For that, I commend you for serving with the SRTs. Whether you asked to, or not. You will be put through the ringer, time and time again, and come out with vital information for the continued success of the Foundation. It will not be easy. You should expect to see those you care for die. But the world outside, and those who protect it, will be much, much, safer with your duty accomplished. Sic un vivant. -H. Weissman, 8/20/1987"
